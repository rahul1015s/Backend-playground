# Express Routing & Contact Form App

This project helped me learn the following key concepts in Express.js:

- How to structure an Express app using **modular routing** with `Router()`.
- Serving static HTML files using `res.sendFile()`.
- Parsing form data with `express.urlencoded()`.
- Handling **POST requests** to process form submissions.
- Using a **custom 404 page** as a fallback route.
- Organizing project folders (`routes/`, `views/`, `utils/`) for better maintainability.
